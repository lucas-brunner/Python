# Python

This is a repo to showcase some of my Python projects. Some programs are written for personal use (such as TempMonitor.py) while others are simply for practice and gaining experience. This will be continuously updated with new projects.

### TempMonitor.py

This program retrieves the temperature and fan speed from the CPU and GPU and sends it to an Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano is programmed in C++ to display the data sent from the Python script on the connected 0.96" SSD1306 OLED screen.
